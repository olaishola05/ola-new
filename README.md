# Developer Portfolio

## Description

A full-stack web application built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript, designed to showcase technical projects and publish personal blogs. The app features dynamic project management (create/edit/delete/toggle visibility), secure NextAuth credentials-based login, and a markdown-based blogging system optimized for performance and SEO.

- Backend: Built with Next.js API routes, Prisma, and MongoDB, supporting relational data for projects and tech stacks.
- Frontend: UI built using Material UI and TailwindCSS for a responsive, branded interface.
- Forms: Managed via React Hook Form and Yup, with real-time validation and error handling.
- Performance: Uses SSG and ISR for fast load times and optimized indexing.
- Email Integration: Email notifications via Resend and React-Email for communication features.

üí° Designed with scalability and real-world use in mind, this project demonstrates my ability to independently deliver a secure, performant, and maintainable full-stack application from the ground up.

## This project is bootstrapped with Fullstack Nextjs Boilerplate
